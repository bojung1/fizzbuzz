# FIZZBUZZ, Vajazzle Style

This is my golang implementation of the FizzBuzz problem.
The main go fizzbuzz package contains only one function for fizz testing on Fizz Mod 3 and Buzz mod 5. 
A case switch handles all cases and returns a string.

The testing suite covers test cases for 1, 3, 20, 30, and a full run of 100 (tweakable, but only by code)

Now with real variable names, not ass or tits!
